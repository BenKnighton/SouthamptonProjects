## Installation
to install Qt, try pip install PyQt5 or pyqt5

However if this doesn't work, you may need to install PyQt desighner from the official Website here: https://www.qt.io/try

### Mac
for Mac users I would highly recommend watching this Video by Codemy.com https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR9dNRvcseU on installing Pyqt and the Designer.

### Windows
Likewise for Windows users there is a video by Code First with Hala https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxSuHyQfStA that documents the process well
